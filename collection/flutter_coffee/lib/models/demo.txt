Dear Admissions Committee,

I am writing to express my keen interest in applying for the Master's degree program in Business Administration at Rice University for the 2023/2024 academic session. Rice University is an outstanding and renowned academic institution, ranked 27th in the Jones business school, and provides an intimate business-learning experience for students like me.

My passion for business began during my university days when I engaged in various buying and selling activities locally within my community. As a child, I helped my mom sell goods in her shop after school, which opened my eyes to the world of business. After university, I worked in an oil and gas company with a small administrative team of 10-15 personnel. The company was worth $200,000 and was a well-established establishment in Lagos, Nigeria. I worked at WilKRISS Nigeria Limited (WNL) for about 2-3 years. During my time there, we won a flare job project worth $500 million, and I was part of the team responsible for analyzing procurement materials. We were able to make a substantial profit by buying materials at a lower cost than the project budgeted for. I received an award at the end of the project for the best business strategy plan/analysis.

Prior to the project at WNL, I gained experience working in the commercial department of a law firm where we improvised and made extra income for the company. The deals we made were an eye-opener for me, and I was able to transact business with some difficult clients and learn how to mitigate risks. I learned a great deal about the major initiatives in the business and commercial sector and various techniques for ensuring sustainable relationships.

I would be honored to be given the opportunity to study at Rice University's Jones Business School. I intend to enrich the learning process by providing a distinctive perspective that comes from my academic and professional background within the West African region's context. During my time at Rice University, I believe that my unique perspective will contribute to a wider and more diverse perspective when exploring relevant topics in lectures and discussions.

Upon graduation, my goal is to utilize the practical knowledge obtained from Rice University's Jones Business School in the company I work for in Africa. I plan to make a difference by analyzing our daily business activities and finding ways to improve our operations. My long-term goal is to work strategically with local and international business leaders and create a smooth, achievable plan for the company's success.

In conclusion, my excellent academic and professional background makes me fit and proper for this program. I appreciate the opportunity to submit my application and look forward to hearing from you soon.

Thank you for your kind attention.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
